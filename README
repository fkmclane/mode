Project description: 

The easiest part of this project: 
Problems that I had in completing this project: 

Issues:
* width/height aren't calculated right for rotated sprites (I think this is an SDL2_gfx issue)
* console causes weird behaviour

Extras:
* sound
* scripting
* console
* animation states

I hope you enjoy an early preview of Mode, a side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you write the rules!
