Project description: Create an early playable game with a controllable player, HUD, collision detection, and AI.

The easiest part of this project: I found coming up with ideas for the framework was easy. It's the making it happen that was hard.
Problems that I had in completing this project: I sorta started adding so much functionality that I got very bogged down. After writing 1700+ source lines of code, I had a new framework I called the "hacker" framework, but very little time to actually test and compose game elements using the framework. Testing and feature completeness will come with project 5.

Issues:
* the sprites aren't showing up right for some reason - their sizes are also wrong
* the music is just a placeholder - I've composed a little bit but nothing of note
* the backgrounds are just placeholers - I still need to adapt a background mockup I have
* the backgrounds do not properly track against the viewport - I copied this code from tracker so I don't know what's going on here
* scripting does not handle collision detection - collision detection code is there but no actions are taken at the moment since the observer pattern is not yet in the script API
* scripting does not handle AI - right now it just demonstrates enforcing gravity with it but can observe the player and take actions

I've got some resources at https://github.com/ProjectPyLink/PyLink/tree/master/pylink/game/res I plan on recreating and merging.

Extras:
* sound
* scripting
* console
* animation states

I hope you enjoy an early preview of Mode, a side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you make the rules!
