Project description: Pizzazz

The easiest part of this project: I quite enjoyed coming up with and testing out cool new things to add and tweak in the game.
Problems that I had in completing this project: I've had too many personal problems to put in all of the work I would like for this. That said, I still put a ton of work into it with regard to the scripting and in-game editor.

Requirements:
* SDL2{,-image,-mixer,-ttf,-gfx}
* expat

Issues:
* width/height aren't calculated right for rotated sprites (I think this is an SDL2_gfx issue)
* death dialog that shows engine-level commands should be shown on player death
* death/birth animations need to be added for all sprites
* death/birth sounds need to be added for all sprites
* first level with defined win goal
* need to test physics raycasting
* need to test platforms
* need to add menu world

Extras:
* sound
* scripting
* console
* animation states
* world (re)loading
* sprite indexing
* background tiling
* dialog abstraction
* code injection
* physics raycasting (unused)
* platforms (unused)
* menu (soon)

I hope you enjoy an early preview of Mode, a side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you write the rules!
