Project description: 

The easiest part of this project: I found coming up with ideas for the framework was easy. It's the making it happen that was hard.
Problems that I had in completing this project: I sorta started adding so much functionality that I got very bogged down. After rewriting 1755 lines of code to 1355, I had a new framework I called the "hacker" framework, but very little time to actually test and compose game elements using the framework. Testing and feature completeness will come with project 5.

Hope you enjoy an early preview of Mode, a side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you can reprogram your enemies!

Fund our Kickstarter today and we will totally ship the game and not just take your money!
