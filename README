Project description: 

The easiest part of this project: 
Problems that I had in completing this project: 

Requirements:
* SDL2{,-image,-mixer,-ttf,-gfx}
* expat

Issues:
* width/height aren't calculated right for rotated sprites (I think this is an SDL2_gfx issue)
* platforms
* menu world

Extras:
* sound
* scripting
* console
* animation states
* world (re)loading
* sprite indexing
* background tiling
* dialog abstraction
* platforms

I hope you enjoy an early preview of Mode, a side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you write the rules!
