Project description: Pizzazz

The easiest part of this project: 
Problems that I had in completing this project: 

Requirements:
* SDL2{,-image,-mixer,-ttf,-gfx}
* expat

Issues:
* death dialog that shows engine-level commands should be shown on player death
* death/birth animations need to be added for all sprites
* width/height aren't calculated right for rotated sprites (I think this is an SDL2_gfx issue)
* need to test physics raycasting
* need to add platform class/drawable
* need to add menu world

Extras:
* sound
* scripting
* console
* animation states
* world (re)loading
* sprite indexing
* background tiling
* dialog abstraction
* physics raycasting
* platforms (soon)
* menu (soon)
* code injection

I hope you enjoy an early preview of Mode, a side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you write the rules!
