Project description: Object Pooling, Explosions, Projectiles

The easiest part of this project: Stealing the sprites from a game I am currently developing was pretty easy.
Problems that I had in completing this project: I have this issue where I keep implementing features faster than I can use them in the game. There's a lot of code there that while it works, is unused. I'll definitely be using them next time around when I have code injection for sprites complete.

Requirements:
* SDL2{,-image,-mixer,-ttf,-gfx}
* expat

Issues:
* width/height aren't calculated right for rotated sprites (I think this is an SDL2_gfx issue)
* need to add platform class/drawable
* need to add menu world
* need to add code injection editor class/drawable to modify sprites in game

Extras:
* sound
* scripting
* console
* animation states
* world (re)loading
* sprite indexing
* background tiling
* dialog abstraction
* platforms (soon)
* menu (soon)
* code injection (soon)

I hope you enjoy an early preview of Mode, a side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you write the rules!
