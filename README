Project description: 

The easiest part of this project: 
Problems that I had in completing this project: 

Issues:
* setting test color does not seem to work - I think it's related to how rendered surfaces are combined
* per pixel collision does not seem to work - I think it's calculating wrong index values

I've got some resources at https://github.com/ProjectPyLink/PyLink/tree/master/pylink/game/res I plan on recreating and merging.

Extras:
* sound
* scripting
* console
* animation states

I hope you enjoy an early preview of Mode, a side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you make the rules!

Fund our Kickstarter today and we will totally ship the game and not just take your money!
