Project description: 

The easiest part of this project: 
Problems that I had in completing this project: 

Issues:
* the sprites aren't showing up right for some reason - their sizes are also wrong
* the backgrounds do not properly track against the viewport - I copied this code from tracker so I don't know what's going on here
* scripting does not handle AI - right now it just demonstrates enforcing gravity with it but can observe the player and take actions

I've got some resources at https://github.com/ProjectPyLink/PyLink/tree/master/pylink/game/res I plan on recreating and merging.

Extras:
* sound
* scripting
* console
* animation states

I hope you enjoy an early preview of Mode, a side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you make the rules!

Fund our Kickstarter today and we will totally ship the game and not just take your money!
