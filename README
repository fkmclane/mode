=== NOTE ===
While I finished the framework, I did not finish putting in game elements for this submission. I'm submitting the framework only for now since it represents a rather large amount of work in writing my own framework with the required features from the spec. I'll submit a playable version sometime over the next three days. Thank you for understanding!

Project description: Create an early playable game with a controllable player, HUD, collision detection, and AI.

The easiest part of this project: I found coming up with ideas for the framework was easy. It's the making it happen that was hard.
Problems that I had in completing this project: I sorta started adding so much functionality that I got very bogged down. After rewriting 1755 lines of code to 1355, I had a new framework I called the "hacker" framework, but very little time to actually test and compose game elements using the framework. Testing and feature completeness will come with project 5.

Hope you enjoy an early preview of Mode, a side-scrolling puzzle platformer where you make the rules!

Fund our Kickstarter today and we will totally ship the game and not just take your money!
